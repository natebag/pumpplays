# PUMP PLAYS POKEMON - RESTART STATUS

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING:
1. **Chat Detection System** - Successfully detecting `!a` commands from pump.fun chat
2. **Browser Automation** - Puppeteer opens Chrome and navigates to pump.fun page
3. **Chat Logging** - Creates `chat_log.txt` file (currently exists but empty content)
4. **System Architecture** - All components properly connected

## ‚ùå CURRENT ISSUES:
1. **Commands Not Reaching Voting System** - `!a` commands detected but not processed as votes
2. **Multiple Process Conflicts** - Several npm processes running causing port conflicts
3. **Chat Log File Empty** - Not writing actual chat content to file

## üîß WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED:

### Issue 1: Commands Not Converting to Votes
- Commands are detected: "Browser detected: Found potential command: !a"  
- But voting shows: "No votes received, skipping move"
- **Problem**: BrowserCollector emits `message` events, but ChatCollector needs them processed through `processMessage()`

### Issue 2: Port Conflicts
- Multiple npm start processes running simultaneously
- System crashes with "EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::4601"
- Need clean restart after killing all Node processes

### Issue 3: Chat Logging Not Working
- File gets created but stays empty
- Periodic scanner should log all new content but isn't writing to file

## üéØ NEXT STEPS AFTER RESTART:

1. **Kill All Node Processes** - Clean slate start
2. **Fix Vote Processing** - Ensure BrowserCollector messages reach ChatCollector properly  
3. **Test Chat Logging** - Verify content gets written to chat_log.txt
4. **Verify Full Pipeline** - !a command ‚Üí detection ‚Üí voting ‚Üí Pokemon game

## üìã TEST CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Chrome opens automatically to pump.fun page
- [ ] Type `!a` in pump.fun chat
- [ ] See "Chat logging to: F:\coding\PUMPPLAYSPOKEMON\chat_log.txt" message
- [ ] See "Command: a from username" message  
- [ ] See actual votes received instead of "No votes received"
- [ ] Check chat_log.txt has real content
- [ ] Verify commands reach Pokemon game

## üöÄ WHEN WORKING:
System will continuously monitor pump.fun chat in real-time, capture `!a`, `!up`, `!down` etc. commands, and send them to Pokemon game every 8 seconds.

## üìÅ KEY FILES:
- `/src/chat/BrowserCollector.js` - Chat detection (‚úÖ working)
- `/src/chat/ChatCollector.js` - Command processing (‚ùå needs connection fix)
- `/chat_log.txt` - Chat logging (‚ùå empty)
- `/.env` - Config (‚úÖ set up)
