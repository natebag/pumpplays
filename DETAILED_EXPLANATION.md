# üéÆ Pump Plays Pokemon - Complete Explanation

## üöÄ What Is This?

**Pump Plays Pokemon** is the first interactive Pokemon Red stream on Pump.fun where the entire community controls the game through chat voting. Inspired by the legendary "Twitch Plays Pokemon," but with crypto-native features that give token holders special powers!

## üó≥Ô∏è How Voting Works (Detailed)

### Voting Cycle (8 Seconds)
1. **Collection Phase (0-8s)**: All chat commands are collected
2. **Tallying**: Votes are counted with weight multipliers applied
3. **Winner Selection**: Most voted command wins (ties = random)
4. **Execution**: Winning command is sent to Pokemon Red
5. **Reset**: New 8-second cycle begins immediately

### Command Processing
- ‚úÖ **Valid Commands**: `!up !down !left !right !a !b !start !select`
- ‚ùå **Invalid**: Ignored (wrong format, non-game commands)
- üîÑ **Multiple Commands**: Only first valid command per user counts per cycle
- ‚ö° **Real-time**: Commands processed instantly when typed

### Vote Weighting System
**Base Users**: 1x voting power (1 vote = 1 point)

**Token Holders** (Recent Buyers):
- 0.01-0.09 SOL: **1.5x power** (1 vote = 1.5 points)
- 0.1-0.49 SOL: **2x power** (1 vote = 2 points)  
- 0.5-0.99 SOL: **3x power** (1 vote = 3 points)
- 1+ SOL: **5x power** (1 vote = 5 points)
